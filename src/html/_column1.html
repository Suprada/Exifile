    Now, we can create highlights and notes on our Scribd books! Yay
    <sup>1</sup>. But so sad, Scribd doesn't provide a way to see all the notes
    and highlights in their entirety, on one page.Even sadder, there is no way
    to download them into our local computers <sup>2</sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alas! our notes and highlights of the Scribd books are forever trapped in
    the cloud.
  </p>
  <p>Or are they? Exifile to the rescue! What is Exifile? Exifile is&hellip;</p>
